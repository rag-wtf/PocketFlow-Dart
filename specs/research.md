# Research: Porting PocketFlow to Dart

## Decisions

- **Language**: Dart 3.x.
  - **Rationale**: The user explicitly requested a Dart port. Dart 3.x offers sound null safety and a modern feature set.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None.

- **Testing Framework**: `package:test`.
  - **Rationale**: This is the standard testing framework for Dart projects. It's well-supported and integrates with `dart test`.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None.

- **Asynchronous Model**: Dart `Future` and `Stream`.
  - **Rationale**: These are the standard constructs for asynchronous operations in Dart, mapping directly to Python's `async/await` and generators/streams.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None.

- **Dependencies**: No binary or native dependencies.
  - **Rationale**: The user specified this constraint to ensure the package is cross-platform and easy to use.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None.

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Very Good Workflows.
  - **Rationale**: The user specified this. Very Good Workflows provide a robust set of pre-configured jobs for Dart projects, including formatting, linting, and testing.
  - **Alternatives considered**: None.
