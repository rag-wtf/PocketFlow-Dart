# Feature Specification: Port PocketFlow's Core Runtime to Dart

**Feature Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Port PocketFlow's core runtime (Graph/Node/Flow) from Python (code located in `third_party/PocketFlow-Python/pocketflow` directory) into a Dart package `pocketflow` that:
- Uses only Dart standard libs and no native bindings.
- Provides unit tests that mirror Python example behavior, same inputs -> same high-level outputs (code located in `third_party/PocketFlow-Python/tests` directory).
Success criteria:
1) `dart test` passes for all unit tests.
2) Code follows Very Good analysis rules and CI runs format, lint, test."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should the system behave when a node in the graph throws an exception during execution? ‚Üí A: The entire flow execution should halt immediately and report the failure.
- Q: How should the system handle a circular dependency within the graph? ‚Üí A: Detect and throw an error during graph instantiation or validation.
- Q: How should the system handle a node receiving an input of an unexpected type at runtime? ‚Üí A: Throw a type error immediately, halting the flow.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to use the PocketFlow core runtime in my Dart applications, so that I can create and execute complex workflows defined as graphs of nodes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a simple graph definition, **When** I execute the flow, **Then** the output matches the expected output from the equivalent Python implementation.
2. **Given** a graph with conditional logic, **When** I execute the flow with different inputs, **Then** the correct path is taken and the output is as expected.
3. **Given** a graph with parallel execution, **When** I execute the flow, **Then** the nodes are executed in parallel and the final output is correct.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a node in the graph throws an exception?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in the graph?
- What happens when an input is of an unexpected type?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a `Graph` class to represent the workflow.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a `Node` class to represent a unit of work in the workflow.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a `Flow` class to execute the workflow.
- **FR-004**: The Dart implementation MUST pass all unit tests that are ported from the Python implementation.
- **FR-005**: The Dart package MUST NOT have any native dependencies.
- **FR-006**: The code MUST adhere to the "Very Good" analysis rules.
- **FR-007**: The code MUST be formatted, linted, and tested in the CI pipeline.
- **FR-008**: If a node execution fails, the entire flow MUST halt and report the error. Nodes MAY support an internal retry mechanism before failing.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST detect and throw an error if a circular dependency is detected in the graph structure upon instantiation or validation.
- **FR-010**: If a node receives an input of an unexpected type at runtime, the system MUST throw a type error and halt the flow.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Graph**: Represents a directed acyclic graph of nodes. It defines the structure of the workflow.
- **Node**: Represents a single step in the workflow. It takes inputs and produces outputs.
- **Flow**: Represents an execution of the graph. It manages the state of the workflow and the execution of the nodes.
