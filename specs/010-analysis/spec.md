# Feature Specification: PocketFlow Dart Port

This document outlines the requirements for porting the PocketFlow Python library to Dart.

## 1. Functional Scope & Behavior

*   **Core Goal**: Achieve feature parity with the Python implementation of PocketFlow.
*   **In-Scope Features**: All features from the Python implementation are in scope.
*   **`Flow` Lifecycle**: The `Flow.run` method in the Dart implementation must be refactored to match the Python implementation's `_run` method, calling `prep`, the orchestration loop, and `post` in that order.
*   **Developer Warnings**: The following developer warnings must be implemented:
    *   Warning when a node's successor is overwritten.
    *   Warning when `run()` is called on a node with successors outside of a `Flow`.

## 2. Non-Functional Quality Attributes

*   **Performance**: Performance is not a primary concern for this port. The Dart implementation should have similar performance to the Python version, but there are no strict performance targets.

## 3. Completion Signals

*   **Definition of Done**:
    *   100% test coverage for all ported code.
    *   A fully functional `quickstart.md` that runs without errors.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: What are the performance targets for the Dart implementation compared to the Python version? → A: Performance is not a primary concern
- Q: The analysis mentions that developer warnings are missing. Which of the following warnings are most important to implement? → A: Both A and B are equally important.
- Q: The `analysis.md` file states the `Flow` lifecycle is incorrect. It mentions `prep`, `_orch`, and `post`. Should the Dart `Flow.run` method be refactored to call `prep`, the orchestration loop, and `post` in that order? → A: Yes, match the Python implementation's `_run` method.
- Q: Are there any features from the Python implementation that are explicitly out-of-scope for this port? → A: No, all features should be ported.
- Q: What specific, measurable criteria will define the "completion" of this porting task, other than just "feature parity"? → A: Both A and B.
