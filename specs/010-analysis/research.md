# Research Plan: PocketFlow Dart Port

This document outlines the research required to bring the PocketFlow Dart implementation to parity with the Python version.

## 1. Asynchronous Implementation in Dart

**Decision**: Utilize Dart's built-in `async` / `await` with `Future`s and `Stream`s to implement the `Async*` classes.

**Rationale**: Dart's asynchronous primitives are well-suited for this task. `Future`s can represent the result of a single asynchronous operation, while `Stream`s can be used for batch processing.

**Alternatives considered**: None, as this is the standard way to handle asynchronicity in Dart.

## 2. State Isolation in `Flow`

**Decision**: Implement a `clone()` method on `BaseNode` and its subclasses.

**Rationale**: To prevent state leakage between runs of a `Flow`, each node must be cloned before execution, as is done in the Python implementation with `copy.copy()`. A `clone()` method will create a new instance of the node with the same configuration.

**Alternatives considered**:
*   Passing a state map around: This would complicate the API and deviate from the Python implementation.
*   Re-creating the flow on each run: This would be inefficient.

## 3. Operator Overloading

**Decision**: Implement operator overloading for `>>` and `-`.

**Rationale**: Dart supports operator overloading, which will allow for the same fluent API as the Python version.

**Alternatives considered**: None, as this is a direct port of the Python implementation's syntactic sugar.

## 4. Benchmarking Strategy

**Decision**: Create a set of benchmark tests that exercise the core features of the library in both Dart and Python.

**Rationale**: To ensure that the Dart implementation is performant, we need a way to compare it to the Python version. The benchmarks will cover:
*   Basic node execution
*   Flow orchestration
*   Batch processing
*   Asynchronous execution

**Alternatives considered**: None, as benchmarking is essential for performance validation.
