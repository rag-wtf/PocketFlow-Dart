labels: test

**Description**

Create failing tests for the `AsyncParallelBatchFlow` class. These tests should cover the basic functionality of the `AsyncParallelBatchFlow`, which is for orchestrating parallel, asynchronous batch flows.

**Requirements**

- [ ] Create a new test file `test/src/async_parallel_batch_flow_test.dart`.
- [ ] The tests should fail because the `AsyncParallelBatchFlow` class is not implemented yet.
