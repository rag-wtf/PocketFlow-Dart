**Description**

Create failing tests for the `AsyncNode` class. These tests should cover the basic functionality of the `AsyncNode`, which is to execute an asynchronous function.

**Requirements**

- [ ] Create a new test file `test/src/async_node_test.dart`.
- [ ] The tests should fail because the `AsyncNode` class is not implemented yet.
