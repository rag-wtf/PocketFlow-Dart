labels: test

**Description**

Create failing tests for the `AsyncParallelBatchNode` class. These tests should cover the basic functionality of the `AsyncParallelBatchNode`, which is for parallel asynchronous batch processing.

**Requirements**

- [ ] Create a new test file `test/src/async_parallel_batch_node_test.dart`.
- [ ] The tests should fail because the `AsyncParallelBatchNode` class is not implemented yet.
