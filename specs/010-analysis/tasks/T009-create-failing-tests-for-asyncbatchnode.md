**Description**

Create failing tests for the `AsyncBatchNode` class. These tests should cover the basic functionality of the `AsyncBatchNode`, which is for asynchronous batch processing in a node.

**Requirements**

- [ ] Create a new test file `test/src/async_batch_node_test.dart`.
- [ ] The tests should fail because the `AsyncBatchNode` class is not implemented yet.
