labels: test

**Description**

Create a failing test for the `clone()` method on `BaseNode`. This test should verify that the cloned node is a new instance with the same properties as the original.

**Requirements**

- [ ] Create a new test case in `test/src/base_node_test.dart`.
- [ ] The test should fail because the `clone()` method is not implemented yet.
