# Research Findings

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: The primary performance goal is to have no performance regressions compared to the Python implementation.
- **Rationale**: The goal of this feature is to achieve feature parity with the Python implementation. This includes performance.
- **Alternatives considered**: Setting specific performance targets (e.g., requests per second) was considered but deemed unnecessary for this feature, as the focus is on functional parity.

## Constraints

- **Decision**: The implementation must be compatible with Dart 3.x and the existing dependencies.
- **Rationale**: To maintain compatibility with the existing project setup.
- **Alternatives considered**: None.

## Scale/Scope

- **Decision**: The scale and scope are defined by the existing test suite. The implementation should pass all existing tests.
- **Rationale**: The test suite is the best measure of the required scale and scope.
- **Alternatives considered**: None.
